				Free movie screening for a great movie, co-produced by Astoria resident Brendan Fay--<br /><br />Dear Friend,<br /><br />District Leader Dorothy Phelan and I are pleased to announce that there will be a very special screening of the award winning film Saint of 9/11 on Thursday, January 25, 2007 at 7 PM at the Jewish Center of Jackson Heights, 37-06 77 Street, Jackson Heights, Queens.&nbsp; Light refreshments will be served. (You can download the attached flier for details or to send it to friends.) <br /><br />Following the screening, Co-Producer Brendan Fay will discuss the making of the film and the life of Father Mychal Judge who the film is about.&nbsp; Father Judge was the first person to die in the attack on the World Trade Center on 9/11.&nbsp; He was the FDNY chaplain at the time.<br /><br />The film, which is narrated by Sir Ian McKellan, was an official selection at the 2006 Tribeca Film Festival, the 2006 Montreal World Film Festival and was a smashing success.&nbsp; It has won many other awards.<br /><br />My advice is to come early to get the best seats.&nbsp; Admission is free.<br /><br />HOLD THE DATE -&nbsp; Thursday, March 1, 2007 - for a special screening of three short films produced by Mr. Fay who is also the founder of the Queens Saint Patrick&#39;s Parade, the topic of one of his short films.<br /><br />If you have any questions, please feel free to call me at 718-457-2928.<br /><br />I look forward to seeing you soon.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Daniel Dromm<br />District Leader<br />39 Assembly District, Part A
