				I did notice the bad air today!&nbsp; I&#039;ve taken to carrying a bottle of water everywhere I go, filling it at home and wherever else I can.&nbsp; The AC has been on for the first time the last two nights.&nbsp; Ice cream is heavenly.&nbsp; I wear lots of tank tops.&nbsp; And I&#039;m sweating away pounds just by walking!&nbsp; Yay!

				I used three fans last night and kept wondering if that was more electricity than just turning on the a/c. Anyway I could figure that out?<br /><br />I also take at least 2 showers a day to keep cool.

				Nor do I have AC, and I don&#039;t want it... except for at night when I can&#039;t fall asleep I&#039;m so hot... &nbsp;I don&#039;t even have a fan. <br /><br />I cope by throwing the hair up in a bun and slouching on my futon until I cool down.

				It&#039;s nice to know I&#039;m not the only one shunning the AC.<br /><br />In the heat last night, we started a little fire in one of the old grills, busted out the guitar and the drums and played a little music while cracking open a young coconut and sipping on some beer.<br /><br />Y&#039;know, I think I like my life the most when I try to condense an evening into a sentence!<br /><br />I know it&#039;s crazy, but I actually love the heat. It reminds me of my favorite cities and my best times. I love working the garden in the hot weather and I love the sweat.

				You know, if it weren&#039;t for steamy hot gross days, we wouldn&#039;t appreciate 80 degree dry and sunny days - like we&#039;re gonna have this weekend. Wooooo!&nbsp; :mrgreen:<br /><br />And I don&#039;t know how you people without AC do it - as much as I&#039;d like to be one of those people who can cope without it, I just can&#039;t. I admit defeat in steamy weather.<br /><br />Also, did anyone else in Astoria witness that crazy 10-minute storm we just had? I&#039;m up at 21 Av, and it was nuts here for a minute with the wind and crazy rain, and a firetruck just went screaming down Steinway.

We were in the backyard and thought we would wait it out, but it turned out to be one of &quot;those&quot;. Rain falling so hard it looked like hail!! It was a bit longer than ten minutes though, more like half an hour. Felt like a tropical rain forest in the yard.

				I like the cold weather (http://angledge.livejournal.com/282096.html), myself..... I sweat like a really sweaty thing when it&#039;s H/H/H like today.<br /><br />I actually went running last night for my Team in Training (http://www.active.com/donate/tntnyc/angledger) workout.&nbsp; I thought I was going to explode from the heat, but I made it 3.8 miles!&nbsp; Now, only all of July &amp; August to survive!&nbsp; Thank God one-third of our workouts are swimming.....

				I don&#039;t have a AC on the first floor.&nbsp; Luckily, my ceiling fan and oscillating pedestal fan keep it comfortable.&nbsp; Upstairs, I have two AC&#039;s.&nbsp; I&#039;m a big girl and I&#039;m ALWAYS hot regardless so without an AC I&#039;d probably never be able to get comfortable.&nbsp; It&#039;s really the humidity that gets to me.&nbsp; I can deal with dry heat but when I&#039;m sleeping I need to be cool.
