				Because I don&#039;t know the specifics of your camera, I&#039;m not much help (I&#039;ve been shooting Nikons for 10 years now), but your best bet is to go to B&amp;H and talk with the guys there.&nbsp; Explain what you&#039;re looking for, be it an adjustable lens, which is a more convenient option, or a wide angle or macro lens for up close shooting and a telephoto lens for shooting at a distance.&nbsp; More likely than not, they will have a number of options, and may let you test out the lenses (just have a roll of film ready in the camera, and a note pad to record which frames you shot with which lenses).&nbsp; Just so you know, a 50mm lens is approximately the view you get from your naked eyes, so you&#039;ll have that plus a slightly wider angle as you adjust toward 35mm.<br />With regard to film, I would also reccommend B&amp;H for both purchase and developing.&nbsp; They have a huge array of film available and their development turnaround is not only quick, but you can also be specific with requests regarding your development times (if you want to get that sophisticated).&nbsp; I would reccommend either Fuji or Kodak professional grade film, I prefer Fuji, mainly because of the way that it tends to play with colors.&nbsp; <br />To get to B&amp;H just take the A/C/E to 34th, it&#039;s not more than a half hour trip to get there, and they will probably be able to answer any questions that may come up.

				B&amp;H is a great resource and source for equipment.<br /><br />Online, I have found the digital picture (http://www.the-digital-picture.com/Reviews/) to be a great comparison tool for exploring different lenses, their similarities and differences. <br /><br />ETA:&nbsp; The link discusses primarily EF-mount lenses; the Canon AE-1 is an FD mount (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_FD).&nbsp; Canon no longer manufactures FD lenses, but they are widely available second hand.&nbsp; You can also buy adapters to use EF mount.
