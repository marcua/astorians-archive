				I gotta agree, that it&#039;s a silly survey. They take at least three dimensions of questions, about government effectiveness, about government intrusion, and about government funding, and treat them all the same. The questions aren&#039;t horribly bad, but the results are totally uninformative.<br /><br />FWIW, I scored a &quot;15%&quot;. Hah, so there. <br /><br />Objective and multidimensional rating scales like the Political Compass (http://www.politicalcompass.org/analysis2) are far more useful. (FWIW, I once scored myself at Economic Left/Right: -3.75, Social Libertarian/Authoritarian: -5.13). <br /><br />

				<br />Your score is 40. <br /><br />You may be satisfied with the size and power of today&#039;s government. <br />It&#039;s nice to be satisfied. <br />&nbsp;:evil:<br /><br /><br />&quot;But if there was important information being withheld from you, would you want to know about it? If the actions of government could harm you or your family, would you want to know about it? If a government program that&#039;s supposed to help people actually does more harm than good, would you want to restrict it to only those areas where it does more good than harm?&quot;<br /><br />** and who was on that grassy knoll ??? **<br /><br />I am trying to think of a survey that really seemed serious. (How much fun is the census?)<br />Many so-called mainstream polls also seem laughable.<br /><br /><br />Here, just passing along a topic and getting a sense of how locals score.<br />I still prefer the Taco Crawl research.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-P<br />Now I may want to take a look at the other link posted.<br />
