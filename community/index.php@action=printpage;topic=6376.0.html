				Ron Paul&#039;s a bit of a nut, and while he&#039;s right to bring up grievances that Al Qaeda used to have (their political goals have almost entirely disappeared into a fog of nihilism (http://www.lawrencewright.com/index.html)), the US&#039; Clinton-era actions in Iraq was not one of them. They were upset about the US&#039; presence in Saudi Arabia (we left after 9/11! they won!), and secularism in the Arab world. Saddam was more-or-less a secularist, and they were no fan of his. I think Paul&#039;s factually wrong here, which is a shame.<br /><br />Rudy, of course, is pulling the &quot;scare the voters and they&#039;ll vote for me&quot; angle, which is obnoxious and insulting.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=6376.msg73917.html#msg73917">Quote from: kungfoofool on May 17, 2007, 09:39:42 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Did you guys see the discussion betwen Ron Paul and Rudy Giuliani on the cause of 9/11?<br /><br />There&#039;s a clip of it on Crooks and Liars (http://www.crooksandliars.com/2007/05/15/ron-paul-vs-giuliani-on-the-root-causes-of-terrorism/) and a followup from Ron Paul on YouTube (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy4Eugc0Xls).<br /><br />I don&#039;t know about you guys, but I&#039;m tired of politicians dragging out the old &quot;They hate our freedoms!&quot; rag.

				From viewing the Crooks and Liars video (can&#039;t access Youtube at work), I&#039;d say that I am in near complete agreement with Ron Paul.&nbsp; Imagine if they did the same to us.&nbsp; Imagine if Iran removed our popular leader and replaced him with a monarchy that suited their needs.&nbsp; Think we&#039;d forgive and forget after a half a century?<br /><br />I thought Rudy responded with shameless pandering.&nbsp; You don&#039;t have to agree with your opponent, but please debate him on his points.&nbsp; In our own democracy, citizens don&#039;t seem to demand such, which is why such pandering garnered the greatest amount of applause.<br /><br />Same thing happened with Ward Churchill in his modern day Malcolm X &quot;chickens coming home to roost&quot; paper, wherein the people in the towers were compared to &quot;Little Eichmanns&quot;.&nbsp; I though it was very provocative and something we could learn from, but he was summarily ostracized with no debate given to his points.&nbsp; Ron Paul will probably face a similar road in the GOP.<br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_Churchill_9/11_essay_controversy<br />

				The whole freedom discussion as it relates to 09/11, the global war on terror and the war on Iraq makes me so sick that I tend not to want to think about it.&nbsp; There were so many other reasons why Al-Queda attacked, not which were justified, that concentrating on the vague nature of freedom, while sounding neat, was inaccurate and harmful to our efforts.&nbsp; It ignored a close and detailed analysis of the enemy(ies) we were facing in this fight and left us ill-prepared for the real fight (case in point, Afghanistan and the threat coming from radical groups in Southeast and South Asia).&nbsp; <br /><br />Regarding Rudy, did you really expect him to respond any differently than he did?&nbsp; His whole national campaign is based on 9/11.&nbsp; I can&#039;t wait until more information about Kerik and all of the sleazy crap that he did in NYC gets revealed as he gets closer to the primary.&nbsp; If people in this group generally don&#039;t want the government intruding in your life, you really don&#039;t want Rudy as your president, even if he is considered the more progressive Republican candidate!&nbsp;

Paul is the most principled and thoughtful advocate of personal and economic liberty in Congress and, presently, on the U.S. national stage at the moment.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />What I find hard to swallow is that the Democrats continue to push a largely socialistic agenda, despite the pile of evidence from the 20th century that central planning is deeply, lethally flawed.

				Just saw the youtube clip (lousy firewall at work!) and was even more impressed by Ron Paul, in particularly since there seemed to be a slight bias against his positions by the interviewer.&nbsp; At least on this issue, he&#039;s neither a nut nor factually wrong.

				I just watched the clip as well. From a behavioral perspective, I kind of agree with Paul. He presents a strong argument, but I don&#039;t think the public is neither ready nor willing to hear it. However, he is describing his interpretation as if he is presenting to an audience that will follow what he is saying and people don&#039;t want to here that &quot;we&quot; did anything wrong. Then Rudy produces a sound bite and rallies the audience beautifully making it look as though Paul said we &quot;deserved&quot; the attack and he will become hated by millions, elevating Rudy. Perhaps our foreign policy and behavior did set the occasion for the attack though. Ya think?

				CNN today (i can&#039;t remember who) someone was criticizing the networks for allowing so many individuals to be invited to debate, not putting a cap on candidate support or popularity, and that the debates were clogged. I disagree with this. I think that by putting candidates that have really no chance of running and/or getting elected to the presidency is a good thing. Without Paul up there discussing the inappropriateness of our involvement in the war, would that point ever have been brought up? Listening to candidates that KNOW they don&#039;t have a snowballs chance in hell gives more spice to the debate. <br /><br />On the other hand, if Paul had never given his perspective, would Rudy have been able to rally support for himself in that manner? Cause its not like the American People have more respect for Ron Paul. The debate soured me even more on Rudy, but I wonder how many had that same reaction.
