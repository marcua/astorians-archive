				WNBC (http://&quot;http://wnbc.weatherplus.com/weathernews/13582154/detail.html&quot;) has a brief item.<br /><br />Also, NY1 (http://&quot;http://www.ny1.com/ny1/content/index.jsp?stid=1&amp;aid=71155&quot;) reports that people in the Bronx and Brooklyn lost power overnight and a feeder cable caught fire. <br />

				I just heard about this.&nbsp; How&#039;s Astoria holding up?&nbsp; I was one of the &quot;lucky&quot; ones who only had to survive six days without power last summer...

				Excellent, apparently this is the new normal now. I&#039;m pretty certain I&#039;ll get to use my wind-up emergency radio I bought after last summer&#039;s no-power adventure.<br /><br />Power&#039;s still on at 30th ave/34th st vicinity... fingers crossed, knocking on wood, etc.

				Power at 21st Av &amp; Steinway in Astoria is fine...<br /><br />I was one of the people who lost power last year, don&#039;t know if that matters.

				You know what else the MTA has apparently neglected and not improved to handle increased load? Their website: http://mta.info/ (http://mta.info/). Totally getting pounded and barely responding... they should at least have a lightweight minimal version for emergencies/events like this where the traffic surge is obviously going to happen. Sigh.<br />

				Yes, considering that it can take an hour to get through to the MTA by phone, they really should put more effort into maintaining their website!
