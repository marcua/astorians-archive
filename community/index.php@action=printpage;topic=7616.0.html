				I wouldn&#039;t call a retail book company not carrying a certain book with such questionable motives as the OJ book censorship. Amazon is actually the biggest bookseller in the world, so there are other avenues to purchase this book if one is so inclined. To my knowledge Astoria only has one bookstore (on Broadway) so whether Barnes &amp; Nobles or Borders or Amazon carry the book has little consequence. Since I grew up in Astoria, I always wondered the literacy ratio of Astorians, since there was no real bookstore anywhere, and few people seemed to notice or even care. If I wanted a book I had to either go to the library to borrow one, or venture to the city to purchase one. Over the last 20 plus years, the big bookstore chains was too much competition for independently owned bookstore, even in Manhattan. Only in Greenwich Village &amp; the Upper West Side are there still several indy bookstores left. Although I do purchase boks online at times or buy from store like Borders, I always prefer to buy from the smaller bookstores like St.Marks or Shakespeares in the Village, even if it costs me a little more. Keeping the independent and mom &amp; pop stores alive is vital not only to the free press, but also to the keeping the middle class alive. If we all have to depend on working for chain stores and big box retail corporations, we&#039;re doomed as a democracy. <br /><br />PLease, support the independent book stores whenever you can.

				I also think it&#039;s important to take in to account that B&amp;N said they won&#039;t regularly carry it. Not that you can&#039;t order it from them or that they won&#039;t get it for you. Also, as part of their standards, when someone orders a book B&amp;N doesn&#039;t regularly carry, that particular store will usually double order the books and shelve one.<br /><br />It&#039;s a lot different from WalMart and refusing to carry certain music, and it&#039;s certainly on the same level considering how much of the CD market share WalMart sells.

It&#039;s in the interest of retailers not to piss off the people who keep them in business and I think they know their customer-base best – this goes for corporate and independent stores alike – and they can use their resources and stock their shelves as they see fit.<br /><br />Taking your argument further – in the interest of free exchange of ideas should B&amp;N stock every single book ever printed? There wouldn’t be a store big enough for that – heck there wouldn’t be a store big enough to house all the new titles published in a single year!<br /><br />Also, is it censorship if a bookstore refuses to carry racist titles, hardcore porn, or torture manuals (Oprah’s book club selections not withstanding) as well? <br /><br />And in regard to the OJ book specifically, does selling the book leave retailers open to legal action by the Goldman and Brown families to sue for any profits that may be made off of selling the book? Someone with a legal background can chime in but even if that’s not the case – what company needs that sort of publicity if they try?<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=7616.msg88908#msg88908">Quote from: Frappe on August 21, 2007, 03:13:32 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">what responsibility do these booksellers have towards the public?.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div> <br /><br />I may be misunderstanding but does your question imply that bookselling is some sort of noble endeavor or public duty and that booksellers are somehow guardians of free speech and dissemination of ideas?<br /><br />My take is that bookstores sell a product. They are commercial enterprises and have no responsibility to the public at all other than what is normally expected in a retail business transaction. I see no infringement of speech or censorship here. No one is stopping OJ from telling his side of the story. He can stand on any street corner and scream it as well as handout print versions to whomever passes by. Free speech is not equal to the right to be published.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				I work in publishing so of course I&#039;ve been hearing lots about OJ&#039;s &quot;fictional memoir&quot;. <br /><br />One thing you need to understand is that B&amp;N and Borders simply DON&#039;T carry every book that is published, period. No bookseller does. Every season they decline to purchase books that we publish simply because they don&#039;t feel it fits their market, or because there are too many competitive titles and they decide to go with something from another house, or simply because the buyer doesn&#039;t like the book or the author. While the OJ book is making more waves because of its content, it&#039;s certainly not news and it&#039;s not censorship. Censorship would be the government saying it can&#039;t be published at ALL--or that anyone buying or selling it will be fined. A bookstore (which is a business) is making a decision on what they think will sell--what will bring them profit. That&#039;s their bottom line. And if anything, independent stores are much more picky about which titles they purchase, and often based on the owner&#039;s personal biases--that&#039;s more along the lines of censorship than a huge chain hearing public outcry (and there WAS public outcry) and refusing to carry something they feel is a bad business decision. <br /><br />Also, did you know consumers can purchase books directly from the publisher? So even if every single chain and Amazon refused to carry this book, there wouldn&#039;t be censorship--the publisher could still create and advertise the book, and customers could get it; the bookstores would simply refuse to be the middleman. <br /><br />I&#039;m interested as to whether B&amp;N will stock it if it becomes a bestseller--that might show you a little more about the true motives.

				Excellent arguements.&nbsp; I&#039;m still not sure which way I would go, because though I&#039;m a big fan of all points of view being heard, I&#039;m a bigger fan of private interests and the government staying out of our business.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t suggest that B&amp;N carry all books, but I think there is a reasonable certainty that this book shall be a moneymaker.&nbsp; The question certainly shall be compounded should it become a bestseller.&nbsp; I further agree that there are other booksellers out there like Amazon.&nbsp; My knowledge of the book industry is limited, however, is it fair to say that B&amp;N refusing to regularly carry the book, and Borders refusing to promote it would atleast moderately affect sales?&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ll sometimes go into a B&amp;N, get a coffee, briefly read through titles and then go and buy the titles I liked from a place like Amazon.<br /><br />Censorship is a tricky word, which is why I keep using de facto censorship, because clearly, it is not a government ordered censorship.&nbsp; Its a possible de facto censorship due to the actions of private interests when their marketshare is so great that the invisible hand no longer feely operates.&nbsp; In the 1950&#039;s the red scare created a form of de facto censorship due to pressure groups.&nbsp; Private interests, movie studios and television networks, which controlled a marketshare akin to the giga booksellers of today, blacklisted actors, artists, writers, et cetera due to the public pressures.&nbsp; More importantly, they had a chilling effect on those not blacklisted.&nbsp; Was it acceptable to say &quot;Hey Jules Dassin is not censored, he&#039;s still making movies in Europe which you can see if you try hard enough&quot;?&nbsp; Was it acceptable for the private interests to use the excuse of the bottom line, or was there a public interest at stake?<br /><br />Granted, there is one hellava gap between the red scare and OJ Simpson and maybe titles that are racist, pornographic and into touture.&nbsp; However, I do not see the specific content to constitute an acceptable excuse, whether its garbage or not (arguments which regard the public interest, like forbidding the sale of pornographic material near schools, is a different matter).&nbsp; Once the de facto censorship of one thing is found acceptable, it makes it easy for others to follow.&nbsp; What if Rupert Murdock acquired B&amp;N and Borders?&nbsp; By no means is that a far-fetched scenario.&nbsp; Some regions only have B&amp;N to purchase books from.&nbsp; What if their only newschannel was FOX?&nbsp; Can we say that there is no public issue here, simply because anyone who wants to may go on the internet for their news?<br /><br />I have to find the references for this, but as an urban planning student, I came across some cases where an interest group argued that the mall effectely replaced the old downtown as the region&#039;s marketplace and center of human activity.&nbsp; Forcing them to hold a demonstration on some little used road where no one would see them would be a form of de facto censorship.&nbsp; Even though there was no absolute ban on them marching anywhere, the judge agreed that even though the mall was a private interest, it had an obligation to allow such, due to its market dominance (of human activity).<br /><br />Good point on Walmart though.&nbsp; Have people raised issue in the past with them on that?&nbsp; I thought I also heard about a major pharamacutical chain refusing to carry birth control?

In 45 states, pharmacists will have their licenses to dispense drugs revoked if they refuse to distribute approved, prescribed products.<br /><br />As far as WalMart and B&amp;N, the goods they provide are not federally and locally mandated in the same way and the goods they provide are strictly luxuries. <br /><br />I have to wonder if opinions would be the same were it a small bookseller refusing to sell a certain book. I know in PA, DE and MD, I&#039;ve seen numerous Christian booksellers. Is it wrong for them to not sell Harry Potter?<br /><br />I think it&#039;s an issue of owner&#039;s choice and in many ways, B&amp;N, through their ability to order instore and have it delievered or held there, provides a lot more accommodation than small bookstores with their own philosophical leanings.<br /><br />Also, I think the decision not to promote or competitively stock the book may stem from the desire to avoid public outcry. I think it&#039;s an itelligent decision. They&#039;ll still sell you the book, but only if you ask them for it.

B&amp;N is not refusing to sell the book to customers, only to stock it in their stores. Special orders are a very common thing with booksellers, independent and chain alike, but it&#039;s only the content of this book that&#039;s making people notice that not every store stocks every book. <br /><br />There was a huge public outcry when OJ was shopping the book around, so much so that the publisher who originally purchased it was fired and her imprint closed down. Now that the Goldman family owns the rights to the book, it&#039;s hard to say whether the outcry will be the same. It might also be that people are tired of hearing about it, think it&#039;s a stupid idea and are giving marketers worse than bad publicity--ignoring it altogether (that&#039;s what I really hope, anyway). <br /><br />De facto censorship is definitely dangerous. However, I don&#039;t think a chain bookstore has any responsibility to the public other than profit. It&#039;s a business--and there ARE plenty of other ways to get books than through a local B&amp;N, even in rural areas (libraries, the internet, direct from the publisher via snail mail, asking a friend to get it when they head into a larger city). I grew up in a small town that had neither an independent nor chain bookstore within 50 miles in any direction, yet I didn&#039;t have problems finding books to read. I can hardly accuse a store trying to make a profit of censorship if they&#039;re offering a book they don&#039;t think will sell, with the caveat of a few days&#039; wait for delivery. It seems like requiring a store to stock a book they think will be unprofitable for them would certainly not be legal, and is in itself a form of censorship--not allowing the business the power of the veto. <br /><br />Again, I think that the concern of censorship falls more on the responsibility of the publisher rather than the bookstore, just as the responsibility of providing safe, lead-free toys falls to the manufacturer instead of Walmart or medication to the doctor/FDA rather than the pharmacist. I think the reason that publication was halted before was that the original court ruling in the OJ case required that he not profit from it, and his million-dollar advance and potential royalty earnings were a clear violation of that. In a way, this could be termed censorship, I guess...but my own personal politics and biases don&#039;t have a problem with it. <br /><br />Will I read this book? Absolutely not. I think if a publisher feels they can make a profit on it, however, they should, and if a bookstore feels they can&#039;t, then they shouldn&#039;t stock it. <br /><br />Great discussion, btw!

				I think its a great discussion too.<br /><br />So we find acceptable the de facto censorship which occured during the 1950&#039;s red scare because it was applied by private interests that claimed to have its strict bottom line as its guiding interest and that it would be possible, albeit more difficult, for the consumer to have access to blacklisted artists?<br /><br />I would say it is a given that B&amp;N not carrying the book, and Borders not promoting it, shall affect its production and consumption.&nbsp; Is there point when a giga bookseller, or a group of them acting in collusion, acquires so much of a marketshare that it some public responsibility can be required?&nbsp; Like it used to be required for privately held trolley and train lines to operate unprofitable routes in order to keep their acquired near monopoly of the profitable routes (know its not the same, but you get the idea).

Particularly a non-perishable, transportable good. Which a great deal of our goods are. <br /><br />This goes along with Frappe&#039;s train and trolley point. A company, with internet sellers and the like, cannot create a strict monopoly on goods that can be shipped without accompaning federal or state regulation. Companies can, however, create monopolies on services because those often are location dependent. Certain services are not, but many are.<br /><br />I would also like to point out that it really isn&#039;t de facto censorship. For it to be that, censorship would have to be &quot;in practice&quot; but given that one can order from numerous other booksellers and given that OJ&#039;s publishers can go to other outlets for advertisement, it really seems like a straw man to label this as de facto.

Self-imposed ban? Not at all. During this time many thousands of Americans were accused of being Communists or communist sympathizers and became the subject of aggressive investigations and questioning before government or private-industry panels, committees and agencies. The primary targets of such suspicions were government employees, those in the entertainment industry, educators and union activists. Suspicions were often given credence despite inconclusive or questionable evidence, and the level of threat posed by a person&#039;s real or supposed leftist associations or beliefs was often greatly exaggerated. Many people suffered loss of employment, destruction of their careers, and even imprisonment. Most of these punishments came about through trial verdicts later overturned, laws that would be declared unconstitutional, dismissals for reasons later declared illegal or actionable, or extra-legal procedures that would come into general disrepute.<br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCarthyism (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCarthyism)<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=7616.msg89510#msg89510">Quote from: Frappe on August 24, 2007, 09:25:50 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I shudder at the day when it becomes difficult to get a copy of Mein Kampf.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>It is banned for sale in Europe.

				http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mein_Kampf<br /><br />I just looked it up.&nbsp; To say its sale is banned in Europe is misleading.&nbsp; The ban is generally in Germany, Austria, Netherlands, Denmark and France.<br /><br />You could make that argument but I wouldn&#039;t.&nbsp; What&#039;s the point of the ban?&nbsp; Given the posts I&#039;ve read here, anyone who might have such proclivities can get a copy if they put some effort into it.&nbsp; I doubt a ban would reduce the chances of slipping back to facism (or pick your poison) and all it would do is add a mystic to hitler.&nbsp;
