				hi all<br />don&#39;t know if anyone noticed but i&#39;ve been missing lately. usually i have enough time at work to at least read all the posts. not any more. i&#39;m as far behind as thanksgiving. granted i should be doing this in my personal time but i went from some days having nothig to do to being here until 7/7:30 a few nights a week. i just get how a company can lose 4 employees and not replace or plan to replace them. instead we&#39;re all feeling the crunch which is leading to other people thinking about leaving. i&#39;m only an admin, but i&#39;m doing some crazy s___. my primary responsibilities are maintaining the showrooms, customer service and essentially office management with all those little odds and ends like soda and paper copy maintanence etc. Now i&#39;m doing the roll of our in house artist-i shoot photos and dabble in making jewelry...outside of writing that&#39;s as artsy as i get. I&#39;m now responsible for presentations and displays. Our planner is gone and used to make UPC line lists of our monthly deliveries. Now on top of the photo line lists i make, i have those too. Can i combine them into one really cool line list-no, i&#39;ve been told. Our VP of sales...the flippin VP OF SALES quit, and I am doing part of his job doing west coast selling reports that i am currently waiting on. my list of things to do actually used to get finished. now even though i&#39;m here til 7 and worked through lunch i still have things that i can&#39;t get too. every day a few things that used to be standard-checking kitchen stock, checking the showrooms even changing the date on the postage meter which sits 2 inches to my left i can&#39;t keep up with. this is crazy. does anyone else work in an office like this, where those left behind are left to pick up the slack. without even so much as a thank you? a raise is totally out of the question-despite having 4 extra salaries floating around. and on top of the sheer amount i have to do, i&#39;m the one who gets stuck lugging boxes and cases of snapple up and down stairs (elevator has been out since march for repairs) and i&#39;ve pulled my back out like 3 times this year. ugh, it&#39;s just so frustrating. i keep getting more and more heaped on me. and i have been looking for a new job with no luck. which makes it all the more frustrating. <br />is it like this everywhere? am i crazy to stay until 7 to finish one thing, only to have neglected 3 others that i have to face in the morning? john and my friends keep telling me that if i am not getting paid overtime i should just leave at 5. but that feels like i am screwing myself. not to mention it will be noticed that i slacked off. not that i think they would fire me, but i don&#39;t want to chance that. 11 months jobless was enough. is it wrong to want to do a good job despite the fact this position does nothing towards anything i want to do, and i think i&#39;ve moved up about as far as they&#39;ll let me. <br />its just so incredibly frustrating and since i actually have time today-covering for the sick receptionist-i thought i&#39;d pop in here and vent....and so there, i have<br />grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr&nbsp; :ticked:

Its a paying job not a friend you are helping out.&nbsp; <br /><br />All that being said, I&#39;m not telling you to quit or anything like that. Money is money, its the holiday season and you do what you feel is important.&nbsp; Just wanted to give some support and wish you the best.<br /><br />(If they don&#39;t give a holiday bonus for all the work then, after the new year, wait for the work to really pile up and then walk out. Leave a note saying you can handle all of it if they give you a raise and promotion.)

				If I were you (and frankly, I&#39;m glad I&#39;m not at this point!), I would do a really kick-ass job at everything (especially the things that are part of the job description of higher-ups), write it all down, and use it to ask for a promotion.&nbsp; Even if it&#39;s only a promotion in name (because, as you mention, there&#39;s no money for raises), a promotion in name will help you get a better job.<br />Just view the hellish aspect as finite, put your nose&nbsp; to the grindstone until it&#39;s over, and use it to your long-term advantage.<br />Hang in there!

				Thanks guys.<br />As i sit here, not doing a damn thing for the first time in a while, and catching bits of gossip here and there (all of it BAD) i think i am going to ask my boss for a raise...again. i asked for one earlier this year and was told i needed an evaluation-which i had, and that it&#39;s completion would happen at the end of the year when all were evaluated and then raises done all at once. guess what? i was the ONLY person evaluated (new system since our new owners). it may be all for naught, but i can at least say comfortably why i feel i deserve one. having had all this extra work dropped on me this year, getting a pseudo promotion (which was more of a title change), doing many things outside the scope of administration and most especially hurting myself on the job for the job. and at least i can say that i asked...again.<br />it&#39;ll have to happen this week, whenever the receptionist comes back. <br />think good thoughts!

				Eeek, sounds like you&#39;re in a sucky situation. I&#39;ve been in similar situations, and I can totally understand both sides of it. I hope it all works itself out soon...and get someone else to carry those Snapple cases! If no one else is available to help you out with those, open them up and make several lighter trips somehow. Back injuries shouldn&#39;t be taken lightly I pulled my back out between two of my jobs (bookstore, lifting heavy book and magazine boxes. ballpark, pulling heavy tarp - even a small amoun of rain makes that thing wigh a TON), and I have ongoing (and most likely permanent) back problems, and while I am pretty much normal, its a slightly nagging headache I wish I&#39;d been smart enough to avoid.

				Firelight, I know where you&#39;re coming from. I&#39;ve been in similar circumstances where I worked hard on big projects with a crazy amount of overttime (no extra pay - I had except status), and despite my extensive background and years of experience, and my ability to run circles around anybody, I was still among those let go during downsizing; they kept lower salaried employees instead. <br /><br />Do yourself a favor and keep looking for a job elsewhere whenever you can, you&#39;ll find something eventually, even if it takes months. Even if your current boss grants you a raise, you&#39;re still killing yourself doing more work than you should have to do, so in the long run it&#39;s not worth it. <br /><br />Good luck.

				Yes, the back thing is serious.&nbsp; Get someone else to do it, or at least to help you.&nbsp; It won&#39;t kill them.<br /><br />firelight, I&#39;m sorry you&#39;re in such a rotten situation.&nbsp; That really sucks.&nbsp; Sounds like you are being taken advantage of.&nbsp; At some point, you&#39;ll have to learn to say no.&nbsp; It may be that point where you simply don&#39;t care anymore about what happens.&nbsp; Sounds like you&#39;re building to that point. <br /><br />Maybe it&#39;s because I&#39;m older and have seen more, but I wouldn&#39;t put up with that s___ that you&#39;re dealing with.&nbsp; I have done it before, and it always ended with me getting fed up and either demanding change or leaving.&nbsp; As I look back on my employment life, I&#39;m happier for sticking up for myself.<br /><br />Good luck, in any case!

				As a man who has made a carrer out of quitting jobs, your situation is less then enviable.<br /><br />With the unpaid OT, it really only makes sense to do such if there is a tangible benefit to doing so.&nbsp; Example, my brother was a lawyer, put in crazy &quot;unpaid&quot; OT, but the raises and promotions were rapid, so in essence, he was getting paid for it.&nbsp; If that ain&#39;t the case, then do not do it.&nbsp; Alex was right.&nbsp; Even if they do give you a raise now, still look for another job.&nbsp; It&#39;ll be the same thing every year.&nbsp; A good boss would not force their worker to share the risk of running a business with them.<br /><br />To their friends and families, bosses boast to how much money they are making.&nbsp; To their employees and the IRS, they complain how little they are making.
