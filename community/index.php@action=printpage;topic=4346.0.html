				Can&#39;t really say why this excites me so much but I&#39;m voting for the man.&nbsp; He has style, determination, middle of the road politics and dances with biker chicks at bars in New Mexico when out campaigning.&nbsp; Met him once and he had a very powerful and charismatic aura about him.&nbsp; Very Ronald Reagan but in a rough southwest democrat sort of way.&nbsp; He could totally take Obama in a death match.

				Jonathan--has he said he&#39;s definitely in the race?&nbsp; I can&#39;t find it on news sites.&nbsp; I think Bayh and Vilsack are the most electable Democrats in the race right now, since Warner decided not to run.&nbsp; Richardson...not so sure he can win it.&nbsp; <br /><br />I think Obama or Clinton might be able to win in 2012 or 2016, but neither has even the slightest chance of getting elected in 2008 (though I agree Clinton will get the nomination, and she is going to lose to a Christian conservative nominee like Brownback, and she&#39;s going to take the congressional majorities down with her).

				Sorry ive missed all the posts today.&nbsp; Anyway Richardson announced yesterday on fox news with one of the talking heads.&nbsp; He is southern, spanish decent, worldly (Clinton UN ambassador) and some other cabinet position.&nbsp; A real peoples person and not big corporate money type. And not liberal.&nbsp; I think he could have a chance.&nbsp; <br /><br />I will also say here that if Bloomberg ran as an independant i&#39;d probably vote for him right after Richardson.<br /><br />

				I think a lot of folks hate Hillary.&nbsp; My mom all but threatened to disown me if I work on her campaign, and I don&#39;t think she was kidding.&nbsp; I like Richardson and Vilsak, but I think Hillary has a stronger organization.&nbsp; I&#39;m surprised by Bayh withdrawing (maybe he&#39;s hoping for VP?).&nbsp; I do hear Richardson has a zipper problem - I wonder if they&#39;ve taken care of that yet.&nbsp; It should be interesting seeing what the field looks like.

Bribe the parties involved to keep quiet?<br /><br />Yeah, it&#39;s an interesting field. It&#39;ll be interesting if interest in Obama can stay high, assuming he runs. And just when Hillary&#39;s campaign collapses. And whether Edwards populism will have any momentum this time. And whether the GOP can find a candidate who can actually both get nominated (i.e., not Rudy) and can actually get elected (i.e., not anyone remotely associated with Bush or congress).

				Edwards looks much better organized this go round.&nbsp; I like Richardson as well - Obama is nice, but I don&#39;t know that I think he has enough experience.<br />I don&#39;t think you can (or should) bribe folks, but I think he needs to know what he&#39;s going to say if and when his dalliances emerge to say &quot;I slept with him&quot;.&nbsp; Is he married?&nbsp; I hope if he is, his aides are making sure he&#39;s being good and not fooling around.&nbsp; Of course, after 8 years of Bush, what is a few sexual indiscretions?&nbsp; Maybe the past eight years have made us think better of impeaching someone for a blowjob!
