				Wow. <br /><br />Um, I picked ESP.<br /><br />I would never never never want to be invisible or see the future. I think seeing the future would 1) really mess me up in the head and 2) just be no fun. I think what makes my life exciting and not wicked depressing is that I don&#039;t know how it&#039;s going to end. <br /><br />Flying might be cool, but I imagine the novelty would wear off, plus how would you deal with people reacting to it.<br /><br />I have no interest in being invincible--what would it be like to be unable to die via normal terms? Yeuck to that.<br /><br />ESP--well, it would probably suck at first, but I imagine that eventally you would learn to control it, or at least it seems like the super power I could control the most.<br /><br />Hah. I basically picked the one that I thought would be the least terrible.<br /><br /><br />

				This was definitely tough and for the sake of just picking one, I went with invisible, but I was torn between that and flying.&nbsp; I&#039;m assuming that it&#039;s the kind of invisible where your clothes turn invisible too and not the kind where you have to get naked or I&#039;d switch it to flight.&nbsp; Being invisible is cool, because you&#039;ve got a neat power, but you still have to be careful or you&#039;ll get caught.&nbsp; One sneeze and your cover is blown!

				Bulletproof...this means everything-proofk I assume. If you are invincible, you don&#039;t have a demise, so no need to see it...no need to be invisible as you can do whatever you want anyway, don&#039;t need to read anyone&#039;s mind cause who cares what they think...they can&#039;t hurt you...

				I took flight (er, take flight?)<br />However, going in I realize the downside.&#160; What if lots of people could fly?&#160; What would that do to air traffic control?&#160; Would I get backed up over Kennedy while trying to get to the south shore?&#160; Would others be bugging me to make pick ups and deliveries for them?&#160; And no, flying doesn&#039;t get combined with super strength, so I don&#039;t think I&#039;m going to be dropping off that 64&quot; widescreen from Costco for you, or anybody!<br /><br />I guess that if society needed me to ferry a briefcase or microfilm across enemy lines, I guess I could fit that in during my lunch hour.&#160; But nobody is gonna carpool home on My back!<br /><br />- Cannibal<br />hmmm, Flying Cannibals!!!

				Teleportation is <em>by far</em> the best choice on the list. It takes less time than flying (which if I really want to do I can hop on a plane or helicopter anyway) and does away with all the hassles of travel. Imagine - no more security at the airport, no more customs to go through (woohoo thriving black market business selling cuban cigars and other difficult-to-acquire in the States goods), and no more worrying about making connections or delays due to weather (which you still have to deal with when flying). Plus, you can go on a vacation, or just a mini-vacation, anytime you want. Hell, if you are craving a certain type of food for a meal, you can just teleport to that country and get the best version of it possible!<br /><br />Plus, since you can teleport right back out, this would be highly conducive to a life of international crime. You&#039;d have the best alibi ever - a blank passport, no name on any passenger manifests, and people who had spent time with you in the states the very same day you commit a crime in another country. Think about it! Uh oh. . . I think I have revealed myself. Okay, so I want to be a super villain instead of a super hero. Is that so wrong?!?&nbsp; :-D

				I rewatched the episode of heroes that revolved around the mind reader cop and his wife, and I deduced that this would be the most useful to me.<br />That said, I wouldn&#039;t mind elasticity a la Reed Richards or the lesser Plastic Man, or the even lesser Elongated Man.&nbsp; Then if I lost my remote, I could still flip channels from the couch, while fetching a beer from the fridge and using the men&#039;s room simultaneously.&nbsp; Really, I would be the ultimate multitasker...
