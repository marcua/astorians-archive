				Has anyone noticed that it is getting dark much earlier now than a month ago?&nbsp; Today the sun set at 7:41 and next Sunday it is 7:30 http://www.sunrisesunset.com/calendar.asp?comb_city_info=New%20York,%20New%20York;74;40.8;-5;1&amp;month=8&amp;year=2008&amp;time_type=0.&nbsp; Even though I look forward to the cooler fall weather this is kind of depressing.

				I hadn&#039;t seen that yet, but it is getting to be that time of year.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been loving this mild, but warmish, weather.

				I&#039;m not a fan of hot weather, so last week was really nice.&nbsp; I personally love the fall, but I have to agree with&nbsp; EddieStjohns that the return of early evening darkness takes some adjusting.

				It&#039;s so depressing. &nbsp;I like the cooler weather but the whole getting dark earlier just sucks. &nbsp;I hate getting out of the office and it&#039;s already nighttime. &nbsp;Makes you feel like you spent an entire nice day inside an office. &nbsp; :-P &nbsp;I wish summer were longer, because it seems like winter lasts forever.

				-&quot;Since September it&#039;s just gotten colder and colder. There&#039;s less daylight now, I&#039;ve noticed too. This can only mean one thing - the sun is going out. In a few more months the Earth will be a dark and lifeless ball of ice.&quot;<br />-&quot;Dad says the sun isnt going out. He says its colder because the earth&#039;s orbit is taking us farther from the sun. He says winter will be here soon.&quot; <br />-&quot;Isn&#039;t it sad how some people&#039;s grip on their lives is so precarious that they&#039;ll embrace any preposterous delusion rather than face an occasional bleak truth?&quot;<br /><br />-Bill Watterson, via Calvin<br /><br />http://chris.ericbosken.net/pages/calvin.html

				I have to echo the sentiments of everyone else. <br /><br />The weather has been AWESOME recently. Perfect for bike riding, walking, etc. I&#039;m trying to get as much out of it as I can before it starts getting dark so early. <br /><br />The worst is when I have to wake up in the dark (around 6:00 am) and then don&#039;t get out of work until it&#039;s dark again. Lame.

				I too have noticed a change in the sunlight and by 8:00 pm it&#039;s almost dark.&nbsp; September and October are my favorite months in the year, esp. in New York. <br />The season change and subsequent colors of fall is intoxicating. <br />

				I&#039;ve especially noticed in the morning when I get up to run. Looks like I&#039;ll have to start shopping for a reflector vest soon. :(

				It doesn&#039;t set in Indiana at 4:30 either. But I got used to it living here and in DC (not 4:30 but still early). I guess it doesn&#039;t really bother me that much.... I looooove autumn weather so much, I look forward to raking leaves!&nbsp;
