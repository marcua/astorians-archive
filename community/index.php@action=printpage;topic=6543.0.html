				I&#039;m considering calling the local precinct to report it - every Sunday - they get new stuff delivered to their garage each week and then every Sunday (it was going to be once or twice a month - but I just heard her tell a &quot;customer&quot; that they&#039;re out there every week) they drag their crap out into the driveway (next to my yard) and then the people start coming.&nbsp; It&#039;s NOT that big a deal... but listening to furniture being moved from 8am - 8pm every Sunday??!!!&nbsp; <br /><br />Today they complained b/c when I was watering my plants the water was getting on the furniture.&nbsp; Ooooops.&nbsp; <br /><br />How long do I play nice neighbor - and when do I call the police?&nbsp; <br />It&#039;s NOT that loud - but it&#039;s annoying.&nbsp; Our yard is generally really quiet and I don&#039;t want to listed to people haggling all day.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				It sounds very peculiar that they have people delivering stuff every weekend.&nbsp; Sounds more like a &#039;business&#039; than an occassional garage sale.<br /><br />I think you should call one of our local representatives and see if their are any guidelines regarding garage sales.<br />

				It&#039;s no longer a garage sale when they have one every weekend and run it as a businessâ€”definitely call local representatives. I don&#039;t know how much the local precinct can help you with that-unless the only thing you&#039;re looking for is less noise. Good luck!

				wow, that is odd. Sounds like they want to have a store without actually having to open one. I thought that&#039;s what the internet was for.&nbsp; :roll:

				If I was in your position, I&#039;d politely talk to them about it and then tell them what you would need them to do in order to allow their market not to imposition you.&nbsp; Its nice to be a nice neighbor and try and work out a compromise, but if their activities impose on you, that&#039;s them not being nice.&nbsp; If they don&#039;t agree, you have their a$$ over a barrel.&nbsp; The Department of Consumer Affairs would be very interested in the operation of an unlicensed market.&nbsp; The State Tax authorities and the IRS would be extremely interested in this as well (garage sales are technically illegal, but no one really cares, but if it is a regular thing, they certainly do).&nbsp;

				Do you live on Newtown? If so, I know exactly what you are talking about, as I stopped by one of their sales last month. They informed me that the &quot;sale&quot; would be every Sunday throughout the summer. I purchased one item, inquired whether or not they had anymore of the same item and was told &quot;check back next Sunday, maybe we&#039;ll get more with future shipments.&quot; The whole thing was really bizarre. They also had a large amount of bags, etc from Cold Water Creek with the tags still on them.

				I&#039;d set up shop next to them and offer better prices, better service, guaranteed!&nbsp; &nbsp;:mrgreen:<br /><br />Make a note of what sells and get your stuff delivered on Friday night and sell it on Saturday.&nbsp;

				If they&#039;re selling cigarettes, the police would LOVE to hear about it.&nbsp; Seriously, the police do shut down illegal operations in Astoria all the time.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure you want to go that route yet, but it&#039;s an option if it&#039;s really bugging you.&nbsp; And if it&#039;s for the church, can&#039;t the sale be moved to the church&#039;s parking lot?

				I&#039;d just like to say....<br /><br />there was no set up (dragging, vacuuming, loud talking in the pre 7am hour) yesterday morning....<br /><br />and this morning..... NO SALE!!!!!<br /><br />The first quiet weekend since May!!!<br /><br />Was it the complaint I filed with the Bureau of Consumer Affairs????? I don&#039;t know.&nbsp; But I filed and now it&#039;s quiet....<br /><br /><br /><br />Perhaps the system works!!<br />
