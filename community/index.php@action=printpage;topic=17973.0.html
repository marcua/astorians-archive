				I walked past Soho today and it was closed.&nbsp; There was paper covering the windows so I couldn&#039;t look inside.&nbsp; Does anybody know anything about this.&nbsp; I was wondering if it closed or is being renovated. :cry:

				They had a sign up last week that they were closing this week for renovations.&nbsp; Should have kept the sign up!&nbsp; I think they were planning to reopen on April 20.

				Can anyone tell me what&#039;s going on with Soho Grill on 31st btwn. 23rd Ave. &amp; Ditmars?&nbsp; It&#039;s been closed for a week now.&nbsp; No signs, no explanations, no announcement on their phone.&nbsp; Have they gone out of business or just on vacation?

				When I passed by Soho a few days ago, the owners seemed to be outside and signs about the ultimate reopening, with changed dates, were restored to the papered-over windows.&nbsp; Apparently, the renovation has been taking longer than originally expected.&nbsp; (I had heard the sounds of electric drills coming out of the cafe, on a few prior occasions.)

				My better half got a tour of the new digs by one of the owners the other day and it&#039;s going to be really swanky when it reopens.&nbsp; &nbsp;There are going to be actual booths and he (my better half) said it reminded him a lot of the high end cafes on 30th Ave and Broadway in terms of decor.&nbsp; Thankfully, the owners are pretty down to earth so I don&#039;t imagine that the eurobeats that accompany the cafes on 30th Ave and Broadway will be thumping for the whole world to hear.<br /><br />The sign on the door says that it&#039;s reopening tomorrow (the 27th).

				Soho has reopened; I like the new decor, they added booths.&nbsp; I think this is the third time they&#039;ve redecorated the place.

				We went tonight- the redo is very nice.&nbsp; The booths make it seem like there&#039;s less table space, even though it&#039;s probably the same amount- you just get more privacy with the booths vs. the old long table.&nbsp; The prices are about the same, and so is the menu- they&#039;ve redone it and added some stuff, but all the old stuff seems to still be there.

				Maybe its just me, but Soho looks exactly the same.<br /><br />And I used to love their smoothies, but then I watched them make one, and it had ZERO actual fruit. Its just ice, and &quot;Mystery Smoothie Mix.&quot; Weeeeak.
