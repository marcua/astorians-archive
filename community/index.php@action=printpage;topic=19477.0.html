				Did anyone witness the Hit and Run at 24th street this morning. 2 cars got into a rather big accident and the SUV with a totally demolished front end sped off with a witness driving a van chasing it. The SUV speeded off and went up to 23rd ave and then came back speeding back down to 24th with the Van still chasing it. The SUV then sped thru stop signs and a red light and the Van ended the chase with the SUV getting away. I read the plate number and called 911. Tonight I went and spoke to the Deli at the corner and he sid the victim in the other car was OK, and it turns out that the SUV left his front license plate at the scene of the accident. Looks like he won&#039;t be to hard to catch up to.

				ah, thanks for posting this! I heard the crash and then saw the one broad-sided sedan at the scene as I walked to work. The driver looked like he was a pilot, maybe? But was uninjured, yes. <br /><br />

				Hey that&#039;s great to hear! I was 2 blocks past the accident and didn&#039;t ever see the sedan that caught the impact or its passenger,&nbsp; I only saw most of the ensuing chase. Thanks for the reply.

				This reminds me of the time I was mugged by a man who dropped his own wallet which the cops found at the scene. It was just too precious seeing pictures of his kids in their karate gear.
