				very interesting. for people who commute to work 5 days a week, $8 a day would add up to $40 a week, and, if my calculations are correct, $2080 a year. If my workplace is any indication, however, a lot of people could probably work from home 2-4 days a week. I also associate commuting from outside the city with high wage earners for whom the 2K would not be such a big hairy deal, but I could be wrong. <br /><br />He also made another 126 suggestions: http://www.nyc.gov/html/planyc2030/html/plan/plan.shtml

				I rarely drive into Manhattan-but if I as a free citizen in a free society wish to go to a show at night -say a concert at MSG - or go to Central Park or something on a weekend&nbsp; - it would really stink - be unaffordable to what&#039;s left of strugging middle class workers in the outer borough. <br />I hope that the state legislators has the bean to stop it.<br /><br />I guarentee you that this will not stop taxis, limos and the rich and that congestion will not improve. This would only be a new revenue stream for the city government, on the backs of the middle class. In the long run having an increased society of the very rich and the very poor without a strong middle class will be extremely detrimental<br />&nbsp;

				As far as the congestion pricing works.&nbsp; It is not for all of Manhattan.&nbsp; It would be for areas below 86th Street.&nbsp; Here is the chart from the Mayor&#039;s Office.<br /><br /><strong><span class="bbc_u">Zone boundaries</span></strong><br />Manhattan below 86th Street, except<br />• West Street and West Side Highway<br />• FDR Drive<br />• Battery Park Underpass<br />• Queensboro, Williamsburg, Manhattan and Brooklyn Bridges and their approaches.<br /><br /><strong><span class="bbc_u">Hours</span></strong><br />6 AM-6 PM, Monday-Friday (no charges on weekends)<br /><br /><strong><span class="bbc_u">Charges</span></strong><br /><em>Autos:</em><br />$8 daily charge to enter, leave, and move within the zone during charging hours<br />$4 daily charge for travel only within the zone during charging hours<br /><em>Trucks:</em><br />$21 daily charge to enter, leave, and move within the zone during charging hours<br />$5.50 daily charge for travel only within the zone during charging hours<br /><br /><strong><span class="bbc_u">Trips bypassing the zone</span></strong><br />Drivers do not pay unless they enter the zone. For example, driving from <br />Brooklyn to the Bronx on the Brooklyn Bridge and FDR Drive would still be free<br /><br /><strong><span class="bbc_u">Toll rebates for E–Z Pass users</span></strong><br />E–Z Pass users paying bridge and tunnel tolls to enter the zone will be credited the amount of their round-trip tolls that<br />day, up to $8. For example, an E–Z Pass driver who now uses the Battery Tunnel to enter and leave Manhattan will pay<br />no additional charge, because the current round-trip toll they pay is already $8<br /><br /><strong><span class="bbc_u">Exemptions</span></strong><br />No charges for:<br />• Handicapped license plates<br />• Emergency vehicles and transit buses<br />• Yellow taxis and livery cabs<br /><br /><strong><span class="bbc_u">Collection technology</span></strong><br />At-speed E–Z Pass readers will allow fee collection without slowing vehicles down. Vehicles not equipped with E–Z Pass<br />will be recorded by cameras and drivers can pay the fee by phone, internet, or at participating retailers within 48 hours.<br /><br /><strong><span class="bbc_u">Revenues</span></strong><br />All net revenues will be dedicated 100% to transportation investments through the SMART Financing Authority<br /><br /><span class="bbc_u"><strong>Operating Entity</strong></span><br />NYC Department of Transportation will control the system, which will be built and maintained by a contractor<br />yet to be selected

				They are trying to promote mass transit, but the downside of that, is that our current transit system can&#039;t handle it.&nbsp; Every train I know of is pretty darn crowded already - NWR7F456123, and then there is Metro-North - which gets so crowded there are not enough seats for the long train ride into the city in the morning.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure LIRR and NJ Transit are the same way.&nbsp; Just where do they think these people are going to fit?&nbsp; I would like to see their proposals on how they plan to handle the crowds.&nbsp; The crowds are horrible as it is.<br /><br />I also do wonder how companies are supposed to deal with their deliveries.&nbsp; $21 per day for deliveries seems an awful lot, and eventually the customers will probably bear some of that cost.<br /><br />Looks like they do plan to charge within the zone as well:<br />Charges<br />Autos:<br />$8 daily charge to enter, leave, and move within the zone during charging hours<br />$4 daily charge for travel only within the zone during charging hours<br />Trucks:<br />$21 daily charge to enter, leave, and move within the zone during charging hours<br />$5.50 daily charge for travel only within the zone during charging hours<br /><br />I do know people who actually own cars in Manhattan, people who&#039;ve lived there their whole lives, who have parking spots in their buildings.&nbsp; This would affect them as well.&nbsp; <br /><br />Personally, I think the hours should be reduced to 6am - 10am, or they should improve mass transit immensely, and they shouldn&#039;t charge delivery trucks at all, or residents of Manhattan to move within the zone.&nbsp; As the program stands right now, I have to agree with Bryan, it&#039;s just a new revenue stream, and a hefty one at that.

				I agree with Daisy about the need to improve and expand public transportation first. &nbsp;There was actually an interesting article or op-ed piece in the Times about the fact that NYC seems to be going backwards in terms of public transportation planning and vision. <br /><br />I&#039;ve always wondered who drives into the city from the outer boroughs on a daily basis for work. &nbsp;The price of gas alone a month would probably be more than a Metro Card and the cost in stress and frustration on one of the bridges (unless you take a toll tunnel) is enough to take years of your life! &nbsp;<br /><br />

Currently you pay $8 or whatever to get into the city from some bridges/tunnels but not others. With congestion pricing, any toll you pay is *deducted* from your fee for entering the city. So if you live in Jersey and enter over the GWB, you&#039;ll end up paying nothing additional under this plan. But if you live in Queens and take the 59th St bridge into the city, your commute will no longer be free. It&#039;ll shift traffic from the current free routes into the city to the toll-based routes. Which authorities get revenue from the tolls? I bet that this feature of the plan will reduce their concerns...

				Improving the transportation infrastructure is actually part of the transportation plan, along with the fare. Check out the summary of transportation proposals (http://www.nyc.gov/html/planyc2030/html/plan/transportation.shtml) and the full transportation report (PDF) (http://www.nyc.gov/html/planyc2030/downloads/pdf/report_transportation.pdf).

				Congestion-pricing has apparently worked in other major cities. I agree with the assessment that public transportation should be improved before implementing this plan, but, overall, I think it&#039;s a good idea. It&#039;s like the mayor said, it&#039;s not &quot;will we pay for it&quot;, it&#039;s &quot;how will we pay for it.&quot;

				I know it works in some cities where it is easier to control access and funnel people through certain points, but how can they implement this?&nbsp; I&#039;d feel bad for anyone who lives just north of 86th street. How will they know if somone in midtown just moves their car across the street?&nbsp; I&#039;m guessing they will just eventually settle for increasing tolls.&nbsp; Sometimes things are proposed that people know will never work to make some other options that would normally be very unappealing look a bit more acceptable.<br /><br />Either way, I&#039;d love to see fewer cars and better alternatives.&nbsp; Pedestrian/street car/bus only streets, etc. Someday...

				The concept sounds interesting, but everyone who drives into the city each day from the suburbs will just come in earlier to beat the clock. A similar restriction was enforced during the transit strike, and many carpooled&nbsp; but still many more simply drove in earlier, alone.<br /><br />Should they try to enforce this restriction?&#160; Absolutely. <br />Will it make drivers think twice about driving into Manhattan?&#160; Possibly. <br />Will the boroughs of Queens, Brooklyn, Bronx, be inundated with cars not entering the city,&#160; and possibly become some kind of huge parking lot?

				The Mayor had a town hall meeting in each of the boros for the 2030 initiative, http://timesnewsweekly.com/Archives2007/Jan.-Mar.2007/031507/NewFiles/2030.html and I would say that more mass transit was very high on everyone&#039;s list of priorities, and congestion pricing was a popular suggestion as well.&nbsp; They&#039;re been testing Bus Rapid Transit, but mainly in low travelled areas, so it hasn&#039;t made much news.&nbsp; The problem is to get the MTA moving on these things, and I think part of the Mayor&#039;s idea is that revenue from congestion pricing, as well as raising the price to park on the street which is another idea in the works, would go to funding these transit ideas.<br /><br />I believe the Mayor has yet to select a new head of the DoT, which will show the real direction he wants to take with the way we travel now.<br /><br />Some people might argue that since they live in a free country they should have to pay to travel into the city, but I think the actual rules are fair, and necessary.&nbsp; I used to have to drive a commercial van in the city to make deliveries when I worked for a carpenter downtown.&nbsp; Even taking the highways traffic was always horrible and cost him money.&nbsp; We don&#039;t want to reduce the amount of non essential commuter traffic just for cleaner air (although that is a plus) but b/c traffic chokes a cities commerce.&nbsp; Which is bad.<br /><br /><br />

				I may have misunderstood the proposal but if the congestion charge will be deducted from existing tolls, meaning drivers who use Port Authority or MTA-run bridges will only pay the difference between the charge and the toll, what the CC essentially amounts to is tolls being implemented on the East River bridges -- which is not exactly a new idea.<br /><br />And there is an argument to be made that people already pay a congestion charge, i.e., the time lost sitting in traffic.<br /><br />I have mixed feeling about the charge. I partly feel that the pulse of traffic adds to the vitality of the city, but conversely we sacrificed too much of &#039;the street&#039; to cars and the needs of drivers.<br /><br />A vast sum of public funds will be spent to put the CC system in place and mainatin its operation. I wonder if the money would be better spent on traffic calming measures to make car travel less enticing (i.e., widening sidewalks, better traffic control, higher tax on parking, etc.) <br /><br />The comparison has been made to London, but NY and London are very different (contraray to many people&#039;s opinions) both geographically and culturally and what worked there may not work here in the same way.<br /><br />One benefit the CC has made to London is that the bus network has been greatly expanded and its truely one of the best in the world. I hope the same would happen in NY.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I totally support this plan. But I&#039;d actually support banning all vehicles from Manhattan altogether. I say double the sizes of the sidewalks, add bike and electric scooter lanes, and just have one &quot;vehicle&quot; lane for delivery vehicles and taxis.<br /><br />I know - crazy...

				I think it&#039;s an awful idea. <br /><br />Manhattan garages employ hundreds of working class folks who will likely be out of jobs when there aren&#039;t cars filling their lots. Those fortunate enough to keep their jobs will likely see a drop in wages because after spending $8 to get into the zone, who will be willing to lay out a decent tip? Many businesses in the city will also be negatively impacted. I can&#039;t tell you how many times I&#039;ve driven into Manhattan to quickly swing by someplace to pick something up, or drove to my doctor&#039;s office when I was sick (actually, last summer I was going to the dr. pretty regularly for about 4 months and was in no shape to take public transportation -- $8 a day would have added up and been a great burden). <br /><br />A lot of people who live in the boros drive out of necessity because of alternate side parking. I&#039;ve had to do it myself on many occasions when I couldn&#039;t find a spot on the right side of the street and have to be in Manhattan in the morning. We&#039;re screwed -- get the ticket or pay the $8. I&#039;d rather pay the $8. <br /><br />If NYers are already willing to shell out the money for parking garages, tolls, gas, etc. to commute into Manhattan, I can&#039;t imagine another $8 will impact their decision to drive, especially if it&#039;s offset by the cost of tolls. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

The best suggestion about congestion that I&#039;ve seen, from Streetsblog, is to radically increase the fee for street parking. A lot of congestion is people driving around in circles looking for a cheap/free parking spot. If there weren&#039;t any, people would go directly to the garages, or would decide not to park in Manhattan. Also, if you set the rates high enough, there will always be spots available for people who need to park on the street, and congestion will be lower. Again, the revenue raised from this could go to public transport, reducing the need to drive in the first place.<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure what to suggest for your street-cleaning issue...<br />

				Many of the parking garages in Manhattan are also being eliminated due to developers taking over the sites for housing, not only on parking lots, but where garages once stood.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think they get as great a return on their space, in many cases, as they do from selling the land for new luxury housing conversion.&nbsp; I think congestion pricing could be very beneficial to the city.

				Make it more expensive for companies to do business in a place, they&#039;ll move. Make it more expensive for people to live in a place, they&#039;ll move. People think, incorrectly, that New York City is somehow, intrinsically, the best city in the world and destined to remain among the most desirable in which to live and work. Every time the cost of living here increases, other cities become more appealing to current businesses and new businesses and existing and prospective residents. New York City has recently become a city that more young people are leaving then coming to. &quot;Making it&quot; here has become excessively burdensome, so people are making it elsewhere.<br /><br />Bloomberg&#039;s real estate tax hikes have helped drive up rents and this new congestion fee thing, however well intentioned, is likely to hurt more than help. The expected consequence will be fewer cars in the city. The unintended but very real consequence will be an acceleration of capital and population flight from NYC and a higher cost of living per capita for those of us who remain. <br /><br />I know people who are hardly &quot;wealthy&quot; for whom their cars are integral to their small businesses. Actors, caterers, guys who run street corner restaurants, independent consultants, teachers who volunteer to bring students to different locations for extracurricular activities... this law makes their lives more difficult, their products more expensive (harder to sell)... so they&#039;ll make different choices, which will have detrimental ripple effects, as well.<br /><br />What would I suggest? Break the monopoly on public transportation and cab medallions. Allow a market to develop in mass commuting. Competition leads to a more efficient use of resources, more options for commuters to choose among, lower prices over time. The government&#039;s monopoly on roads and mass transit has stifled innovation in the development and implementation of options for people seeking a way into and around NYC. If I wanted to start a company in NYC that competed directly with cabs and utilized a fleet of hybrid cars, how far would I get? <br /><br />If you still believe the government should be involved in mass transit and needs more money to spend on deploying better options, maybe you should advocate, vociferously, that before the city finds a new way to bleed taxpayers it should cease and desist the hundreds of millions of dollars spent on subsidies to businesses and real estate developers and divert those funds to new transit development. I still think the answer lies elsewhere, but this would be easier for me to swallow than another attack on people&#039;s hard earned dollars. Just a thought.

				The money businesses lose to congestion pricing they will make up with reduced transit times for deliveries and whatever other activities they require an automobile for.&nbsp; Also the fee will be considered tax deductible since its a business expense.&nbsp; Several commerce alliance groups love this idea because the cost of doing business has gone up due in part to extended transit times for commercial traffic.<br /><br />

				That was an interesting article Frappe.&nbsp; I think the stats generally speak for themselved in in it, but my favorite was this &quot;Drivers make up just 16 percent of all the commuters who work in this dense section of Manhattan&quot;.&nbsp; Most people that live in NYC do not own a car, this plan benefits the majority, and is being held up by a vocal, and in most case wealthier, majority.<br /><br />I have a hard time believing that there is this flood of low income people who pay to maintain a car, pay for gas to commute daily, pay for parking on a daily basis and pay car insurance.&nbsp; I think most people that rely on cars on a daily basis tend to be wealthier, or at worst middle class.&nbsp; Many people say, &quot;Gosh if they put this thru, I just won&#039;t drive into the city anymore, so there&quot;, as if that&#039;s some sort of punishment to the city.&nbsp; Thats the point, the charge is supposed to act as a deterrent, not a toll.<br /><br />Now I know that there are areas in the outer boros, like Bayside and most of Staten to give two examples, that aren&#039;t well served by buses and mass transit, and that needs to change before 2009 when this proposal would go into effect.&nbsp; But mass transit alone won&#039;t do it, Americans need to feel the pinch to their pocket books.&nbsp; This will do that and pay for expanded mass transit.<br /><br />One last anecdotal story about those &quot;long&quot; mass transit commute times from places like Long Island.&nbsp; My current boss lives near Jones Beach.&nbsp; He bikes, everyday, to the LIRR station there, and takes the train into the city, where he switches to the subway and rides that the rest of the way to SoHo (Spring and 6th Ave) where we currently work.&nbsp; Takes him 45 minutes.&nbsp; I live a 5 minute walk to Astoria Blvd station and take it to Soho as well, no transfers (I walk from Prince to 6th Ave) and it takes me an hour.&nbsp; Long transit my ass.&nbsp; Plus on the ride home he has drinks with his commuting buddies.

				I can&#039;t speak to Staten Island, but I go to Bayside via mass transit with some regularity and use both express bus service and regular bus service, and it&#039;s not that bad.&nbsp; Not much worse than a train.

				I&#039;ve never actually been to Bayside, but I hear that as an example from anti-congestion pricing folks when they say &quot;How will the people who live in Baysaide and aren&#039;t properly served by transit going to get to work?&quot;.&nbsp; Good to hear its not as bad as that, although some more BRT would be great regardless I think.

				For the folks that check here and not the calendar, Transportation Alternatives is having another forum on congestion pricing, this one right here in Astoria, this Thursday.&nbsp; Here&#039;s the link for more info, http://www.astorians.com/index.php?topic=6562.0<br /><br />Although it may seem like this is an issue that only NYC has to resolve, the Mayor needs to get permission from the state legislature, and the Speaker will begin this hearings on this Friday, so this should be an interesting event.

Now it&#039;s over $3 a gallon. Back then, if you told people that gas was going to be as expensive as it is, they would have told you that they would drive less, buy smaller cars, etc. But how much effect has the increase in prices really had? Not very much. Fewer people drive across the country, I guess, and SUV sales are down (but big pickup sales are up), but everyone still drives to work, and it&#039;s not like the streets of New York and Los Angeles are empty. <br /><br />Financial incentives work really well for businesses, who have penny-pinching managers trying to make the most money possible, and also have the ability to invest in new methods to reduce long-term costs. They seem to work considerably less well for individual people and families.<br /><br />So, will congestion pricing actually work, like it mostly did in London? Or will it just be seen as an annoyance by drivers who will just glower and pay the fee?<br /><br />(Presumably it will work to improve traffic flow over the QBB, as the Midtown tunnel will immediately become less expensive.)<br />

Is the makeup primarily commercial vehicles, passenger vehicles, trucks, vans, etc.?<br /><br />I wonder because if the bulk of the congestion is caused by commercial vehicles that really have no choice but to travel into that area via car/truck, then the impact on traffic flow will be negligible while the impact (financially or change in commuting method) is felt solely by commuters (and presumably consumers who will likely face an increase in the cost of goods and services to offset the increased delivery costs). <br /><br />Just wondering... <br /><br />

				Apparently, the fee is going to be charged to Manhattan residents <em>exiting</em> the zone as well. So if one lives, for example, in Gramercy Park and drives to work outside of the zone, they&#039;ll be charged the $8 fee, however if they stay within the zone, they&#039;ll only be charged $4 (which would be the same as the charge for a roundtrip Metrocard, so where&#039;s the incentive to leave the car at home?).<br /><br />Suddenly Manhattanites aren&#039;t quite as supportive as they were... <br /><br />http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/30/nyregion/30congest.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin
