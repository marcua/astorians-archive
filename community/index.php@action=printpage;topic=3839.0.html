				Hi all.<br />I&#39;m back state-side and am so excited about the upcoming featured reader at the upcoming Words @ Waltz reading Series.&nbsp; I first met Hal Sirowitz in 2001 at a reading at the Vault in Queens and have been a huge fan ever since.&nbsp; His work isn&#39;t only insightful and evocative, it&#39;s laugh out loud funny.&nbsp; So come on out, bring some work to share, and read on for details, Hal&#39;s bio and a sample poem.<br /><br /><div align="center"><strong>Words at Waltz reading series featuring the incomparable Hal Sirowitz<br />Monday, October 30th<br />8pm Sign up, 8:30 Start<br />Waltz-Astoria Cafe<br />23-14 ditmars boulevard<br />FREE</strong></div><br />Take the N or the W to Ditmars, turn west/left onto Ditmars, and Waltz&#39;s is about 7 blocks down on your left.<br />www.waltz-astoria.com<br /><br /><br />Hal Sirowitz is the author of six books of poetry, although probably best known for the volumes Mother Said, My Therapist Said, &amp; Father Said.&nbsp; He&#39;s a 1994 recipient of an NEA Fellowship in Poetry and has performed on MTv and at Lalapalooza.&nbsp; He is currently the best selling translated poet in Norway, where his work has also inspired a much loved animated series.&nbsp; Hal is a cult figure of sorts in literary circles throughout the world, as a poet, a performance artist, a comedian, a teacher, and an all-around good guy.&nbsp; Born in New York City in 1949, he&nbsp; was the last Poet Laureate for the Borough of Queens, NY.&nbsp; His father was a salesman in New York&#39;s garment district, and his mother, Estelle -&nbsp; well, she worried. <br /><br /><br /><strong>Not Talking To Me Again</strong><br />(from Mother Said)<br /><br />Beauty is only skin deep, Father said,<br />but don&#39;t tell your mother I told<br />you that or she&#39;ll think I&#39;m saying<br />that she&#39;s ugly. But I didn&#39;t marry her<br />just for her looks. I married her because I thought that she was kind.<br />I happen to be wrong tonight. But<br />that doesn&#39;t mean I won&#39;t be right tomorrow.<br /><br />

				Hi all.<br />Just sending out a reminder and an update regarding the Words @ Waltz Reading Series this Monday.&nbsp; Come out to here the wildly popular Hal Sirowitz...and...a special guest.&nbsp; James Keepnews of Metroland Mediagnosis fame will make a special guest appearance to read his essay that makes a convincing comparison between the Bush Regime and Axl Rose.<br /><br />Between Hal and Jamie, this is an evening not to be missed!&nbsp; <br />

				I met Hal at a party in the East Village in.... 94 I think... I was thinking about becoming a teacher at the time -but was unsure.&nbsp; Especially about being in a city system.&nbsp; He&#39;d taught in NYC for years as a special ed teacher and he totally inspired me and made me believe I could do it.&nbsp; <br /><br />I quit my job and went back to school and .... have been teaching 10 years.... <br /><br />okay... he&#39;s not the only reason... but he&#39;s part of my inspiration for teaching in new york.&nbsp; <br /><br />I won&#39;t be able to make it Monday night (taking the students to the GLAMOUR MAGAZINE WOMEN OF THE YEAR AWARDS - wahoo) but dang... I&#39;d like to thank him.&nbsp; <br /><br />Would one of you let him know... he inspired someone... <br /><br />please.&nbsp;
