				I think it&#039;s great, but I would love to see more than a three man race. Throw in Bloomberg and a real conservative and people might have a real choice outside of the two party fixed system.<br />Nader by himself won&#039;t make much of a splash. After the weekend news cycle, I doubt he&#039;ll get any news coverage.

				<br />I liked Obama&#039;s response to Nader&#039;s interest in running. But Nader says he wants to see a fuller more vibrant democracy.<br />I hope that the Dem &amp; GOP nominees will address issues that his campaign raises.<br /><br /><br />Ralph seemed to have a very high opinion of his site. But so far, it seems rather slight.<br /><br /><br />http://www.votenader.org/issues/

				The irritating thing about Nader is, no matter how you may be able to get behind what he&#039;s saying it, he doesn&#039;t say enough, loudly enough the 4 years he&#039;s not runnng for office.

				<br />This election, the major party candidates might get far more than 60 Million votes, perhaps each party.<br /><br /><br />Do you think Nader might get far more than the 400,000 + votes from the last election? <br />:?&nbsp; And many of those were from NYS.<br /><br /><br />I dont think the nominees will lose as many voters to Nader as they did in 2000.<br />Right now, we dont know how Nader would be on the ballots or how much of a challenge his campaign will build.<br /><br /><br />I imagine that candidates campaign more smartly now than they did in 2000, using more engaging technologies. They cant take voters for granted as much as they used to.<br />And voters seem much more interested and fired up.<br /><br />

				I don&#039;t know why the democrats are worried, seeing how many votes Nader lost from the 2000 to the 2004 election. It would&#039;ve been better if Clinton and Obama had just not commented on it, or said something like &quot;Hey, this is a democracy and he&#039;s welcome to run along with anyone else.&quot; I wish politicians would realize it makes them look bad when they go around insulting others.
