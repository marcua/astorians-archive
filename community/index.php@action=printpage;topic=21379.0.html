				Windows covered with brown paper. It was just open yesterday.<br />(Dekko is the very pretty little cafe on the northwest corner of 31st St. and Newtown Avenue, with a small but varied food menu and a great brunch.)<br />FYI, their latest DoH sanitation grade was &quot;A,&quot; per the DoH website, with a mere 5 points.<br />I hope they&#039;re just expanding the bar or something; they&#039;re a great neighborhood place.

				UPDATE: Via a brief email, management says they&#039;re doing &quot;a few minor renovations&quot; and should reopen in 2 weeks.

				That is interesting.&nbsp; I have yet to try this place, but was interested in their Jazz Brunch.&nbsp; I thought it would be great the next time my parents came for a visit.&nbsp; Unfortunately, when my parents came this weekend, I called to ask about the Jazz Brunch and they don&#039;t have it anymore.&nbsp; I was disappointed.&nbsp; I hope they bring that back!

				Yes, we were also sad to see the Jazz Brunch go. I&#039;m guessing they did it to get people out of the house in the cold weather, and didn&#039;t see the need for it once they could open the outdoor tables. I imagine it would also be a little more challenging to put on with doors and windows open, what with the N train rolling noisily by.<br /><br /><br />Just guesses on my part.<br /><br /><br /><br />I hope they bring it back when it turns cold again.

				I really like this place.&nbsp; I spoke to them the last time I was there.&nbsp; They said the furniture choices were a mistake.&nbsp; The chairs they picked have a huge footprint and are uncomfortable.&nbsp; And I think they need a bar area where people can sit at the bar.&nbsp; Most people don&#039;t like sitting at tables having cocktails if they come to unwind after work.&nbsp; But I think their food is very good and they&#039;re nice people and offer good service.&nbsp; Price point is right too IMO.&nbsp; But I did notice that the outdoor seating was a bit tough with the train right overhead and Finkelsteins installing tires.

				I never minded the noise outside; I sat on basically the same patio many times when the space was Zodiac, so I&#039;m used to it. (I&#039;m also a subway nerd, which helps.)<br /><br /><br />I guess the chairs could be comfier. And yeah, they need a real bar area.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />I&#039;ll be back when it reopens.

				I&#039;ve been going here regularly since the weather has picked up - went last week and almost had a fit when I saw the paper on the windows. That &#039;Closed for Renovations&#039; sign was up on Zodiac&#039;s windows for like a year and a half so I was skeptical. The fact that the place was mostly empty every time I was there led me to suspect they were in fact going out of business. <br /><br />Has anyone been by? If they really are only closed for two weeks I think I might do cartwheels down the office hallway. I really liked the vibe, sandwhiches, and cold coffee beverages.

				<br />yeah, I really enjoyed their food (and killer sangria), and was always worried to see how empty they always seemed to be (I tried to patronize them as regularly as I could). <br /><br /><br />I walk past there every day, so I&#039;ll report back here when I see signs of life...

				Damn, places opening&nbsp; and closing at faster and faster pace.&nbsp; &nbsp; Soon someone will&nbsp; have grand opening for lunch, and&nbsp; go out of&nbsp; business after dinner.

I know the economy isn&#039;t great, but damn...<br />In the 30th Ave area alone, we have:<br /><br /><br />-Meli bakery (30th Ave &amp; 32nd St) They spent way more time building the place than ended up actually being open. Looks like place is currently gutted, and the signs are down.<br /><br /><br />-Pasha (31st St &amp; Newtown) No idea what happened with this place. They just abruptly closed one day, never to reopen (and they had an &quot;A&quot; DoH grade!). I&#039;m guessing the change from Bosnian grill to what seemed like &quot;generic hot food buffet&quot; didn&#039;t go over well?<br /><br /><br />-Dekko (across the street 31st St &amp; Newtown) &quot;Closed for renovations&quot;. Hope they do actually reopen soon. Their adjoining club (Cierra, I think?) IS still open.<br /><br /><br />-Dino&#039;s (30th St &amp; Newtown) closed and reopened as <strong>G</strong>inos (guess they saved money only changing one letter on the sign! ha). Went from sort of clubby vibe to more of a &quot;family pizzaria&quot; place, from what I&#039;ve observed from the outside. That location seems to close and reopen under a different name (with a dumbed-down menu each time) regularly, every couple years. Last time I ever went there was back when it was Amici Amore. That said, the latest iteration seems to be doing a fairly good business.
