				Gay Republicans find chill climate in Washington after sex scandal<br />by Stephanie Griffith Tue Oct 10, 6:20 PM ET<br />WASHINGTON (AFP) - Gay Republicans say the scandal involving lurid emails sent to minors by a gay Republican lawmaker has hurt their efforts for greater acceptance within their own party.<br /><br />The controversy over lewd computer messages sent to underage congressional workers by disgraced ex-representative Mark Foley (news, bio, voting record) has exposed a serious rift between party progressives and Christian conservatives, and increased internal fears that a fractured Republican party faces a greater chance of being defeated in next month&#39;s national elections.<br /><br />The internal culture war pits socially liberal party members -- who say tolerance and outreach are key to ensuring sufficient recruitment for the future -- against Christian conservatives who form the party&#39;s base.<br /><br />Patrick Sammon, executive vice president of the national gay group Log Cabin Republicans said recently that the situation has left some homosexuals in his party &quot;feeling under siege, both as gay and lesbian people and as Republicans.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;If Foley broke the law, he should be prosecuted. His sexual orientation is irrelevant to this story,&quot; he said.<br /><br />&quot;Predictably, anti-gay groups have used this awful situation to push their divisive agenda,&quot; Sammon said. &quot;They are using this scandal to try and score political points.&quot;<br /><br />Since the Foley scandal broke, conservatives have been more vocal than ever about their wish to exclude homosexuals from their ranks.<br /><br />The conservative Family Research Council said the scandal showed that the party&#39;s efforts at inclusiveness had gone too far.<br /><br />&quot;The Foley scandal shows what happens when political correctness is put ahead of protecting children,&quot; said Tony Perkins, president of the conservative interest group shortly after the scandal broke.<br /><br />&quot;This is the end result of a society that rejects sexual restraints in the name of diversity,&quot; he said.<br /><br />&quot;Maybe it&#39;s time to question: when is tolerance just an excuse for permissiveness?&quot; Perkins said.<br /><br />His group, in a separate statement, had particularly harsh words for the GOP leadership.<br /><br />&quot;They discounted or downplayed earlier reports concerning Foley&#39;s behavior -- probably because they did not want to appear &#39;homophobic,&#39;&quot; the Family Research Council wrote.<br /><br />Washington&#39;s community of gay Republicans includes at least one US lawmaker, Representative Jim Kolbe (news, bio, voting record) of Arizona, who disclosed his sexual orientation in 1996, after a gay magazine threatened to out him.<br /><br />Washington&#39;s gay Republican scene is also reported to include dozens of high-ranking congressional aides, current and former White House staffers, advisers to the Pentagon, press strategists, well-known journalists and influential lobbyists -- most of whom choose not to make their sexual orientation known for professional and personal reasons.<br /><br />They say they are even less likely to do so in the current climate which is less hospitable than ever to homosexual Republicans.<br /><br />Underscoring that point, in recent days, an anonymous message has been circulating around Washington, &quot;outing&quot; various alleged, unacknowledged gay lawmakers and senior congressional staff.<br /><br />Copies of the document, known cryptically as &quot;The List&quot; have been sent to conservative groups like the Christian Coalition, Focus on the Family, the Family Research Council, and Concerned Women of America, among others, according to news reports.<br /><br />But one twist on the story is that the &quot;outing&quot; according to some sources, is being carried out by Democrat-friendly gay groups, who are outraged that some gays would cast their lot with a party seen by many as espousing politics that run counter to the best interests of the community.<br /><br />For his part, Foley acknowledged after the scandal came to light that he is gay, a closely held secret that he chose not to make public for fear of political repercussions.<br /><br />But his attorney has said Foley is not a pedophile and says that he never had sex with any minors in the congressional page program.<br /><br />&quot;It&#39;s definitely a shame that he wasn&#39;t able to come out when the issue was just his sexuality,&quot; Eric Johnson, an openly gay chief of staff for a Democratic lawmaker in the House who once worked on Foley&#39;s campaign for Congress, recently told the South Florida Sun-Sentinel newspaper.<br /><br />&quot;When he comes out at the same time of these revelations you can&#39;t help that some people will equate that (being gay) with being a pederast,&quot; he said. &quot;It&#39;s not true.&quot;

				It&#39;s an interesting article but I&#39;m not sure why gay Republicans would decide only now that their party is unfriendly towards gay people. Haven&#39;t this been going on for quite some time?&nbsp; Where was the outrage then?&nbsp; <br /><br />Foley&#39;s being gay has nothing to do with being a pedophile.&nbsp; &nbsp;Yet now, it&#39;s being used as one more weapon against full equality.&nbsp;

				I find the Family Resource Council&#39;s attack/excuse that the Republican leadership did not go after Foley for fear of being called homophobic laughable and offensive.&nbsp; This is the Republican leadership that drafted and has repeatedly pushed the Federal Marriage Amendment which would write discrimination into the constitution.&nbsp; They don&#39;t care if they&#39;re called homophobic, they are proud to be homophobes, they terrorize younger LGBT folks with &quot;conversion&quot; programs that don&#39;t work and think stopping bullying in schools is a bad idea as the bullying will force gender variant and LGBT youth to &quot;conform&quot;.&nbsp; The idea that being called homophobic would cause them to anything is a joke.&nbsp; They didn&#39;t move on Foley because they wanted to hold control of Congress - that&#39;s why they got the head of the Republican Congressional Campaign Committee involved early on, and then hit Foley up for large donations.&nbsp; They are immoral people.
