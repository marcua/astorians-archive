				Has anyone noticed nightly helicopter shining a spot light down?&nbsp; Its just about every night around midnight, it does a few laps around, from what appears to be Ditmars down to Broadway, and then leaves.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t seem to be looking for anyone because it never really hovers in one spot, and its every night.&nbsp; Any body know whats going on here?

				Yeah, it was nuts last night. It stood poised above 23rd Ave. for maybe fifteen minutes--- it had the blinking lights going, the insane noise... and that radiant celestial spotlight. It would beam down towards Crescent St. and slowly drag South and back West. It was lower than I&#039;d ever seen it. I went out on the fire escape to observe. Suddenly the copter darts away, swinging over the Park and in an arc towards Hoyt Avenue. And back again toward 23rd Avenue. I thought I saw someone moving with a flashlight through my alley. I hope they were really looking for someone, because if not - well, maybe they&#039;re just looking!?

I checked the Gothamist Newsmap and it shows nothing going on<br />around the times that you stated. Did it look like a NYPD aviation chopper? Did you see a red light blinking?

				I live up near Ditmars and 21st.&nbsp; We&#039;ve had the helicopters 4-5 nights during the past two weeks.&nbsp; Usually they either go back and forth or stay stationary.&nbsp; I have not gotten up to look, but they sound like they&#039;re about 100 feet over my apartment.&nbsp; Hope they stop soon.

				I&#039;m at Ditmars and 36th street and it&#039;s bugging me too. My housemate said she&#039;s been hearing it since this afternoon. I wonder if it has to do with the Amtrak track work. Doubt it but just a thought.

				The chopper was back last night...&nbsp; &nbsp;Any one see it?<br />Ip80, I was thinking that last night when i saw it flying over my house.&nbsp; The spot light wasn&#039;t on or anything so there was really no reason for it to be flying around.&nbsp; Ip, are you a cop?&nbsp; <br />Is that not a waste of taxpayer moneys? I am a little confused as to why they have to &quot;put these vehicles in service&quot;.&nbsp; I could only imagine that if is expensive to gas a helicopter, and pay a pilot for over an hour.&nbsp; I know its not like the defense budget or anything, but it still is a waste, no?

				Why would you want them to stop, it&#039;s probably some sort of counter-terrorism training exercise. <br />If you believe that, I&#039;ll tell you another.

				they were looking for some one last night, they had the spot light. searching all&nbsp; the back yards and alleys.&nbsp; there was police car parked on ditmars and 29 st. with all his lights flashing. a few minutes before i heard voices in my back alley, and some one ran.&nbsp; &nbsp;they were after some one. maybe that is who they were looking for.
