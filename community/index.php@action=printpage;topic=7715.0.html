				Found this article interesting:<br />http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/29/nyregion/29damage.html?ref=nyregion<br /><br />Kinda reminds me of the 1970s when there was that huge winter storm and the city didn&#039;t plow any of the streets here. <br /><br />Anyway, that article talks about the people that were flooded in the storm earlier this summer. The theory is basically that all this development that&#039;s been going on, new buildings where there were none, huge buildings replacing much smaller old ones, is basically taxing the already inadequate sewer lines in queens. The article doesn&#039;t mention&nbsp; &nbsp;last years&#039; Con Ed disaster but it should have. More apartments, bigger homes = more demand for electricity on a grid that con ed barely seems to bother maintaining. It&#039;s only a matter of time before this seriously starts to effect the subways too. People complain about the N being packed at all hours these days, and with more and more people moving in, it&#039;s not going to change any time soon. Getting the MTA to increase service is like asking for a tax break... it rarely happens.<br /><br />Is it just me ( which I doubt, Queens Crap complains a lot about this: http://queenscrap.blogspot.com/) or is high time to stop this development insanity, at least until some of this infrastructure can be expanded? Perhaps there should be a surcharge on these developers so the city can collect funds to use towards better sewer lines when a new building is build or expanded?<br /><br />The bad old days of NYC didn&#039;t make me or my relatives leave the area... but I think if this overdevelopment/under investment continues, I&#039;ll be heading for the hills... kind of ironic that the &#039;success&#039; of NYC is what is currently causing so many people so much grief.

				I don&#039;t read the Crapper, but I do think overdevelopment is an issue as it relates to inadequate infrastructure to handle it.&nbsp; I don&#039;t mind development, but I do think we should at least update services to handle the influx of people.&nbsp; It only makes sense.

				The Queens Crap blog uses posts on this board to further and support the opinions in that blog, just like OuterB (http://outerb.com) does in its blog.&nbsp; But the astorians posts linked to on Queens Crap still contain passive-agressive digs at the people that participate here. <br /><br />I stand by my statement that it appeared to me that the protests around St. Savior&#039;s gave the impression that the community group didn&#039;t expect to win the battle. I&#039;m not going to get into that here, but if you want to talk about it, please post a comment on the offending post on OuterB.<br /><br />As far a my response to the OP here, yes, I took one little element of it&nbsp; But did I crash down on the meat of his POV about overdevelopment in Queens?&nbsp; No, I did not.&nbsp; I want to see the discussion bloom and then speak up when I feel I have a handle on the direction the conversation is going.&nbsp; Perhaps a cautious approach, but it works for me.&nbsp; I find the Queens Crap blog rather mean-spirited, moreso that simply critical, so I voiced my opinion about it.&nbsp; It&#039;s really just an opinion, too.&nbsp; It&#039;s ok to disagree, too, just like I&#039;m doing with you.<br /><br />However, in light of this, I&#039;ll apologize for steering the thread in a different direction.&nbsp; It will be interesting to see in which direction the conversation goes apart from this.<br /><br />Now... pot calling the kettle black about autopilot?&nbsp; Posts on OuterB run the gamut, from issues of preservation, overdevelopment and new developments.&nbsp; And things in between.&nbsp; In my opinion, the Queens Crap blog has a narrow agenda.&nbsp; OuterB prefers a different approach.&nbsp; <br /><br />I don&#039;t mind that you came to challenge me, Crapper.&nbsp; But I don&#039;t have time for an all-out flame war, sorry (I&#039;m really being genuine with this statement - work is a bit intense right now and flame wars are very draining for me).&nbsp; <br /><br />Some may be enjoying this exchange, others won&#039;t, but it&#039;s bordering on breaking board rules regarding personal attacks.&nbsp; Mods, please let me know if this exchange has crossed the line.&nbsp; Thanks.

But I do get the sense from some of the over development crowd that no amount of infrastructure upgrades would be enough to stop them complaining. I think the issue is more about new people (particularly diverse people) coming into the neighborhood, and the scenery changing rather than an honest debate about infrastructure. If the issue was about sustainability you would see them (like most of us) focusing on the fact that the infrastructure be upgraded and rules be put in place that makes the development sustainable rather than just putting an &quot;end&quot; to development.<br /><br />It seems that these people moved or immigrated to the city years ago thinking that once they got here and built a nice home(s) for themselves that the development would stop.<br /><br />That being said; welcome to the board QueensCrapper.

				MegC: I noticed that as soon as something that certain people say gets challenged, phrases like &quot;breaking board rules regarding personal attacks&quot; and &quot;flame wars&quot; suddenly appear.&nbsp; Now that is something about this blog that I see commenters criticizing on my blog.<br /><br />&quot;the astorians posts linked to on Queens Crap still contain passive-agressive digs at the people that participate here&quot;&nbsp; <br /><br />Really? Here&#039;s the first: <em>&quot;Sometimes the folks at the Astorians message board can give you a good chuckle: http://www.astorians.com/index.php?topic=5505.0 (http://www.astorians.com/index.php?topic=5505.0).&nbsp; They&#039;re making fun of the plans for the building pictured.&quot;</em> and the second: <em>&quot;Hey, guess what? According to the Pistilli Development Group, Astoria is a utopia where garbage doesn&#039;t stink and you&#039;ll never step in dog crap...Here&#039;s an old article from the Queens Gazette about the complex...Here are some select comments from the message board, Astorians.com...People are laughing at you, Mr. Developer.&quot;</em><br /><br />I think you may be looking for something between the lines that isn&#039;t there.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also, either my blog is about me complaining about &quot;everything&quot; or it has a narrow agenda.&nbsp; Can&#039;t have it both ways.<br /><br />As for welcoming me to the board, Merm, no need to do this, for this is not my first post.&nbsp; I have been a member since January and made my first comment then.<br /><br />The original post was about lack of adequate sewers and electricity to service the many units that have replaced one family homes and caused burden on the infrastructure. It seems that the consensus is that it may be partially true.&nbsp; <br /><br />Just when I thought maybe someone might actually <em>answer</em> the two questions he posed, though, the conversation was again steered - this time toward &quot;racism&quot;, which is exactly what Queens politicians like to do when they don&#039;t want to handle a legitimate concern.&nbsp; Queens is the most diverse borough in the world, and we generally all get along, now don&#039;t we?&nbsp; The problem is not whether or not my next door neighbor speaks with an accent.&nbsp; The problem is when my next door neighbor rents out their basement illegally, I report it to the department of buildings, nothing is done about it and then someone down there starts a fire which engulfs my attached home.&nbsp; Or when the whole neighborhood illegally converts their basements and then mine gets flooded because the sewers can&#039;t handle being overtaxed.&nbsp; Those types of problems cut across ethnic lines.<br /><br />&quot;It seems that these people moved or immigrated to the city years ago thinking that once they got here and built a nice home(s) for themselves that the development would stop.&quot;&nbsp; <br /><br />Try born and raised here.&nbsp; Why is that never considered as a possibility?&nbsp; And why am I being referred to as &quot;these people?&quot;

While you&#039;ll find lots of people (yes, even the &quot;newcomers&quot;) who are concerned about the slow pace of infrastructure to support booming development, you&#039;ll also find that there&#039;s a number of people within that community that just don&#039;t like newcomers. So in effect, even though a majority might actually agree that development should be taken more slowly, and infrastructure upgraded, it&#039;s hard to join the over development voice because there&#039;s so much vocal people-phobia (and yes, I&#039;ve personally observed flat out racism on multiple occasions) within that crowd - which, as I commented I find ironic since many of them immigrated or moved to NYC themselves during a development boom, had kids, and fully participated in building a poorly planned infrastructure that couldn&#039;t meet the needs of anyone who came behind them. Still, you don&#039;t see all the newcomers to the neighborhood blaming the old-timers for not building a well-planned infrastructure that could be upgraded - and neither will I, I just find it ironic.<br /><br />I wasn&#039;t necessarily talking about you QueensCrapper as the original topic really isn&#039;t about you. Nobody likes blackouts - in my personal opinion the over development crowd as a movement isn&#039;t exactly providing constructive dialog, nor are they very welcoming.

				I am uninvolved and do not align myself with any development groups, nor am I familiar with them.&nbsp; As someone who&#039;s lived here 10 years and seen the changes just in the last 5 years alone,&nbsp; I can say there is a problem in Queens infrastructure to handle the influx of people already here, and there are tons more on the way.&nbsp; The crowded trains at all hours.&nbsp; The 9 day blackout.&nbsp; The flooding.&nbsp; &nbsp;The traffic.&nbsp; The crowded streets.&nbsp; Even the amount of social spots on 30th Ave.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure there are more problems I don&#039;t know of.&nbsp; Develop all you want, but update the infrastructure to handle it, or else we&#039;ll all be pretty miserable with the results.&nbsp; I know I already am and others are as well (with the issues I listed).

				This is not directed towards any specific person or comment made but the point I was trying to make in my previous post was that the number of complaints about ‘development’ seem to far out number and are disproportionate to the actual increase in population leaving me to wonder what exactly is bugging people? <br /><br />To frame the development discussion strictly in terms of lack of infrastructure as compared to growth just doesn’t quite fit and my feeling is that Merm has a point that it can feel like “people-phobia” at times.<br /><br />Is it “anydevelopment” or “overdevelopment” that is the problem?&nbsp; Because for some it seems no amount of growth or change is acceptable and I would like to ask what would you like this city to be – Detroit? Buffalo? St. Louis? – cities which essentially have been depopulated? <br /><br />New York once teetered on the edge of an abyss and younger or newer resident may find it hard to fathom but once upon a time, one not so long ago, no one wanted to live in this city.<br /><br />Some of the changes I see in Astoria make me very anxious. It’s as if my history is being erased but at the same time I would much rather see a thriving, dynamic neighbourhood/city with more buildings going up than ones sitting empty and derelict AND at the same time growth that is managed and focussed on the quality.<br /><br /><br />By the way QueensCrapper – I read and really enjoy your blog and I say keep on complaining. I agree with you on many of the issues but the problem of unregulated basement apartments is not one of overdevelopment it is of illegal development, which to me is quite different and you are right that the city often does nothing.<br />

				I&#039;m fine with development and change, but I would like the city, MTA, Con Ed and the developers to work together to not only maintain, but update and increase the services in relation to the influx of people that development brings to Queens.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think that is happening right now, and things are being built with no thought to the impact on the community it will have, being that the infrastructure is adequate to handle it.&nbsp;

				Thank you 28Grand! &nbsp;Some great points you made there. &nbsp;<br /><br />I tend to define overdevelopment in terms of what was there before and what is there now structurally. &nbsp;The building that is being promoted we are told is to prepare for &quot;1 million more people&quot; yada yada. &nbsp;How they determined there will be or should be 1 million more people is something I&#039;d like to know. &nbsp;From what I understand, the 1961 zoning was done in anticipation of having some ridiculous number like 30 million people by the year 2000. &nbsp;We fell far short of that number, and I can&#039;t imagine what this city would be like if we had that many people living here.<br /><br />There&#039;s not much more space left, which is part of the reason for the recent sewer problem - no place for the ground to do the absorbing. &nbsp;What I do on QC is research what was there before vs. what is there now. &nbsp;If I see a one-family or open space was replaced with a 3-family or larger, then I tend to post about it. &nbsp;<br /><br />I also tend to post about just really freaking ugly houses. &nbsp;You can tell what the government&#039;s agenda is for your neighborhood by what&#039;s being built there. &nbsp;These days, it&#039;s either high rise luxury condos for the upper echelon, or Fedders crap for the lower echelon. &nbsp;Real quality middle class housing is not being built anymore, although I guess you can make an argument that McMansions fall into that category, where you have a lot of house taking up a little bit of space. &nbsp;Still, they add to the infrastructure problems of electricity and flooding.<br /><br />Time Out New York actually recently did a feature on racial views in the city and it revealed that ethnic populations tend to segregate themselves intentionally for a number of reasons and racism among them may actually exceed that of the &quot;Archie Bunker&quot; types QC readers are accused of being. &nbsp;I&#039;ve found most people in Queens &nbsp;really don&#039;t care where you&#039;re from as long as you don&#039;t them any harm. &nbsp;People warm up to each other eventually. &nbsp;Of course, if you don&#039;t speak English then it&#039;s kind of hard for most people to get to know you or for you to accept me into your world, for that matter. &nbsp;That&#039;s just reality.

				In my opinion this infrastructure problem is something thats happening around the country.&nbsp; For the last 30 years or so politicians on both sides of the fence both federal and local have been falling over themselves to get votes by cutting property taxes, tax rebates etc.&nbsp; And local budgets have compensated by making cuts where they can, including things like roads and bridges, mass transit and power.&nbsp; Remember the big black out of 2003?&nbsp; That was because the grid got hit by lightening and the whole system got fried.&nbsp; And if I remember right, the whole thing was blamed on our aging power system, which hadn&#039;t been updated.&nbsp; Same thing with the Western Queens black out.&nbsp; The trains are too crowded, I agree.&nbsp; Well when Koch was mayor the MTA got 200 million a year from the city/state for its operating budget.&nbsp; Over time its been cut down to 70 million a year.&nbsp; Thats a lot less, particularly when you figure the dollar isn&#039;t worth as much as it was a few decades ago.&nbsp; Either way our infrastructure is going to need improvements whether or not the hyper development continues.<br /><br />Certainly guys like ConEd and MTA need to get their act together in many regards, but at the same time the money to maintain and improve the infrastructure needs to be budgeted from somewhere, either in cuts to other parts of the budget, or from property/income taxes or from pricing plans and sale taxes, but at the end of the day, the money comes from us.&nbsp; And no one wants to pay for anything&nbsp; (Tax collection is screwed up too and favors the rich now more than ever but that a whole other rant).<br /><br />As for over development, I moved here from PA almost 7 years ago, not sure if I count as one of &quot;those people&quot; or if I&#039;ve been here long enough to be one of &quot;them&quot;, but I try and be involved in the hood.&nbsp; You can&#039;t just put a moratorium on development, in an area like NYC where people come to live here, all that&#039;ll do is drive the rents and apt prices up even more, and the only thing to stabilize it would be folks no longer wanting to live in NYC, which would be bad.&nbsp; On the other hand, I don&#039;t want to see towers blocking the river either.&nbsp; The city needs to work out a better system, to keep some housing affordable, still allow the developers to make some profit and start to bring the infrastructure up to snuff, none of which really seems to be happening enough.&nbsp; I don&#039;t have an answer for that one, just stating the obvious.

As kids we used to use industrial wooden doors for rafting ala Huck Finn. It&#039;s one of my favorite childhood memories. The sewers are probably blocked again so it might worth a call to 311 or the EPA.
