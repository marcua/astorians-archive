			I am a new member and I posted this question a week or so ago and can&#039;t find it anywhere so I will post it here. <br /><br /><br />I am new to the Astoria area, was so happy when I found this site and am sorry it&#039;s shutting down.&nbsp; Since I hope to buy into the area in the near future, what other community forums would you recommend for obtaining info on various condos such as if the management is responsive or if there are pending lawsuits?&nbsp; Thank you!!

			Just logging on to say how much this forum meant to me while I lived in Astoria, a place I still feel connected to even though I live all the way across the country in Portland, OR. I met some great people though these forums, attended some awesome Astorians events, learned about Freeze Peach here, and overall it gave me a sense of community. Big thanks to merm for running this forum and also to the merm-Meesh team who ran Freeze Peach. Rose Garden will forever be one of my favorite teas, too.<br /><br /><br />I know we have Facebook, Nextdoor, and other social media these days, but I maintain that hyperlocal forums and - for the olds among us - local BBSes are superior when it comes to community-building and connection. I still maintain friendships I built through those pre-social media online communities I frequented in the 90s and 2000s. But I also understand that merm needs to shut things down here, and I accept that. <br /><br /><br />So, adios everyone. Be well, stay safe, and love Astoria!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

			Well…we’re down to the last 48 hours of this wonderful place.&nbsp; To think how much has transpired since this forum started.&nbsp; We’ve gathered to have brunch together, we met at our fellow Astorian’s homes.&nbsp; We laughed, and cried, and shared so much.&nbsp; I want to thank the moderators present and past for creating this wonderful place.&nbsp; I’m sad.<br /><br />May 2022 be better for all of us, health and love to all.&nbsp; Cheers &#129346;
